# Gold Price Prediction using ARIMA & LSTM

This project compares classical time-series (ARIMA) and deep learning (LSTM) models for gold price prediction and trading strategy evaluation.  

## Project Highlights
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- ARIMA model forecasting with rolling refits
- LSTM model training on technical indicators
- Backtesting strategies with transaction costs
- Evaluation metrics: MSE, Sharpe Ratio, CAGR, Max Drawdown
- Equity curve comparison: Strategy vs Buy & Hold
